Brylie Christopher Oxley is the visionary behind Piano Fitness, bringing together his passion for music education with his expertise in software development to create a tool that addresses a specific gap in piano technical training.

### Background & Expertise

With over a decade of experience in software development, Brylie has specialized in creating applications that solve real-world problems through thoughtful user experiences and robust functionality. His work spans multiple domains including education technology, wellness, civic engagement, and creative tools.

Brylie's technical expertise includes:

- Full-stack application development using modern frameworks
- Open source software development and community management
- User experience design focused on accessibility and clarity
- Cross-platform development for mobile and desktop environments

As a musician himself, Brylie understands the challenges of developing piano technique and the importance of structured, consistent practice. This first-hand experience informed the core design principles of Piano Fitness.

### Development Philosophy

Brylie approaches software development with a set of guiding principles that are evident throughout Piano Fitness:

**Minimalism with Purpose**: Brylie believes that the best tools don't try to do everything—they do one thing exceptionally well. Piano Fitness embodies this philosophy by focusing specifically on technical development rather than attempting to be an all-encompassing piano learning solution.

**Technology as an Enabler**: Rather than viewing technology as a replacement for traditional learning methods, Brylie sees it as a powerful enhancement that can provide immediate feedback and guidance that would otherwise be unavailable outside of in-person lessons.

**Open Source as Educational**: The decision to make Piano Fitness open source reflects Brylie's belief that transparency in code can serve an educational purpose—allowing others to learn, contribute, and adapt the software to serve diverse needs.

**User Autonomy**: Brylie designs software with the user's independence in mind. Piano Fitness is built to empower pianists to take charge of their own technical development, providing tools for self-assessment and progress tracking.

**Continuous Iteration**: Believing that software is never truly "finished," Brylie embraces an iterative development approach, constantly refining Piano Fitness based on user feedback and emerging best practices in both software development and piano pedagogy.

### A Personal Note from Brylie

> "Piano Fitness grew from my own experience struggling with technical aspects of piano playing. I found plenty of resources for learning pieces, but there was a gap when it came to structured technical development with feedback. I created the tool I wished I had—one that would complement lessons and other learning methods by focusing specifically on building technical proficiency.

> As both a developer and musician, I believe in the power of technology to enhance, not replace, traditional learning. Piano Fitness is designed to work alongside teachers, method books, and repertoire-focused applications to create a more complete learning ecosystem."
