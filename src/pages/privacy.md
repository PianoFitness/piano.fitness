**Last Updated: March 23, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to Piano Fitness. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any information shared with us through our mobile application ("App") and website ("Website"). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure.

Piano Fitness is designed as a technical development tool for piano students, providing interactive exercises and practice tools. Our fundamental principle is to collect only the minimum information necessary to provide and improve our services, in alignment with the data minimization principle of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Piano Fitness is operated by [Your Company Name], a company registered in Finland and subject to European Union data protection regulations. As such, we are committed to complying with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws.

## Information We Collect

### Legal Basis for Processing

Under the GDPR, we must have a legal basis for processing your personal data. Depending on the type of data and the context, we rely on the following legal bases:

- **Consent**: Where you have given clear consent for us to process your personal data for a specific purpose
- **Legitimate Interests**: When processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or those of a third party (such as to improve our services), provided those interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms
- **Legal Obligation**: When processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation
- **Contract Performance**: When processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take steps at your request before entering into a contract

### Information You Provide Directly

Piano Fitness does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the basic features of our App. We do not collect personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it, such as when you:

- Contact us through email or our Website
- Submit feedback or report issues
- Contribute to our open source project on GitHub

When you voluntarily provide information, we process it based on your consent or our legitimate interest in responding to your inquiry or feedback.

### Information Collected Automatically

#### App Usage Data

Our App collects limited non-personal technical data that helps us understand how users interact with our features:

- **Usage Statistics**: Information about which exercises and features are most frequently used
- **Performance Data**: Technical information about how the App performs on your device
- **Device Information**: Basic information about your device type, operating system version, and App version

This information is collected in an anonymized form and cannot be used to identify individual users.

#### Website Analytics

Our Website uses analytics tools to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior patterns. This helps us understand how visitors use our Website. Information collected may include:

- **Visit Duration**: How long you spent on our Website
- **Pages Viewed**: Which pages you visited on our Website

We take measures to ensure this information is collected in an anonymized form. However, we acknowledge that the combination of certain technical identifiers could theoretically narrow down the number of possible user agents.

### Information From Third Parties

#### App Store Data

When you download our App from an app store (such as Apple App Store or Google Play), we receive aggregated statistics from the store provider, which may include:

- Number of downloads and installations
- App store ratings and reviews

This information is provided to us in aggregate form and does not include personally identifiable details about individual users.

- Provide, maintain, and improve our App and Website
- Understand how users interact with our services
- Identify and address technical issues
- Develop new features based on user preferences and usage patterns

- Respond to your communications or feedback

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or lease your information to third parties. In accordance with GDPR principles, we limit data sharing to what is necessary and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place. We may share anonymized, aggregated data in the following limited circumstances:

### Service Providers (Data Processors)

We work with third-party service providers who help us operate, develop, and improve our services. Under GDPR, these service providers act as our data processors. They may include:

- Analytics providers
- Hosting and cloud infrastructure providers
- Development tools and bug tracking services

These service providers are only permitted to use your information to provide services to us and are bound by data processing agreements that require them to:

- Process data only according to our instructions
- Implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures
- Assist us in fulfilling our GDPR obligations
- Delete or return all personal data after providing their services
- Submit to audits and inspections to verify compliance

We ensure that all data processors provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in compliance with GDPR.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

- Comply with a legal obligation, including GDPR and other EU data protection laws
- Protect and defend the rights or property of Piano Fitness
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing
- Protect the personal safety of users or the public

Any such disclosure will be made in accordance with applicable data protection laws and with appropriate safeguards for your privacy.

### Business Transfers

If Piano Fitness is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.

## Open Source Considerations

Piano Fitness is an open source project with code available on GitHub. If you choose to contribute to our project through GitHub, please be aware that:

- Your GitHub username and any information in your GitHub profile may be visible to others
- Comments, issues, and contributions you make to the project are public

You can opt out of certain analytics tracking:

- **Do Not Track**: We honor Do Not Track (DNT) browser settings
- **Mobile Device Settings**: Your mobile device may offer settings to limit ad tracking

### Your GDPR Rights

As a data controller based in the European Union, we are committed to respecting all your rights under the GDPR. These rights include:

- **Right to Access**: You can request copies of your personal data that we hold.
- **Right to Rectification**: You can ask us to correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.
- **Right to Erasure**: You can ask us to erase your personal data in certain circumstances.

- **Right to Not Be Subject to Automated Decision-making**: You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.

Since we do not collect personally identifiable information through the App itself, there is generally no personal data to access or delete. However, if you have contacted us directly or believe we may have collected information about you, you can exercise any of these rights by contacting us.

To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Us" section. We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month.

## Data Security

In accordance with GDPR requirements, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including:

- Pseudonymization and encryption of personal data where appropriate
- Measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems
- Processes for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of our security measures
- Measures to restore access to data in the event of a physical or technical incident

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information in compliance with GDPR and other applicable laws, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Data Retention

Following the GDPR principle of storage limitation, we retain the limited information we collect only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Specific retention periods vary based on the type of data and its purpose:

- **Analytics Data**: Retained for up to 26 months, after which it is either anonymized or deleted
- **Contact Information**: Retained as long as necessary to address your inquiry and for up to 12 months afterward for follow-up purposes
- **Technical Support Records**: Maintained for up to 24 months to ensure continuity of service and support

Once the retention period expires, we securely delete or anonymize the data unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

## Children's Privacy

Our App and Website are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we may have collected information from your child, please contact us, and we will take appropriate steps to remove such information.

## International Data Transfers

Piano Fitness is based in Finland, a member state of the European Union. We process and store data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable EU data protection laws. If you access our App or Website from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), please be aware that information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the EEA or other countries where our service providers are located. We take steps to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your data remains protected to the standards described in this policy.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. For significant changes, we will provide more prominent notice, which may include an in-app notification or email.
